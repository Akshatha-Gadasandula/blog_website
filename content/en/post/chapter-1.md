The Amalfi Coast is one of Italy’s most breathtaking stretches of coastline. Winding roads carved into cliffs offer stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea, quaint fishing villages, and terraced vineyards. Taking a bike ride here is not just a journey, but an adventure of a lifetime.

Why it’s a must-do

Scenic Beauty: Every twist and turn reveals a new postcard-worthy view.
Challenging yet rewarding: The route is ideal for cyclists looking for both a physical challenge and mesmerizing scenery.
Cultural exploration: Along the way, you can stop by small towns like Positano and Ravello to explore ancient architecture, art, and local cuisine.
Best time to go
April to June or September to October, when the weather is pleasant, and the crowds are fewer.

Pro tip
Consider renting an e-bike if you're not a seasoned cyclist, and start your ride early in the morning to avoid heavy traffic.
